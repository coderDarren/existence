Two Modes:
    1. RPG Mode
        - In this mode, the player is restricted by the game environment. In short, this is the mode you play when you want to play as if you were actually living in the game. You don't get to choose the name you start off with. You don't get to choose your race, gender, physical appearance, or otherwise. You don't even get to choose your underlying profession. There may be opportunities in the game to modify your name, physical appearance, or profession - but it won't be as easy. 
    2. Classic Mode
        - You can expect to follow the typical character creation process in this mode. 

Leveling:
    - Titles:
        > Freshman (No respect from NPCs) LV. 1-4
        > Intelligent (Choose your faction) LV. 5-9
        > Sentient (Access to professions, research/memory, unique skills) LV. 10+

Memory:
    - Memory is like research
    - Memory is earned via brain chip slots in the equipment tab
    - You can use memory to obtain perma buffs (passives) or learn new skills
    - Some memory benefits are profession locked
    - Each chip slot has a long term storage (LTS) memory timer. The timer is based on usage of particular skill. Higher level chips reach LTS faster. IF you unequip a chip, you lose existing progress on the LTS memory. Chip LTS speed will also be influenced by the level of weapon, or skill, used to increase progress.
    - Memory lines will be broken down on a per skill basis
    - Each chip has a minmax mastery level range
    - Chips may burn out over time, even in the middle of progress. When a chip burns out, existing progress in that line is lost.
    - Higher quality chips will reduce the changes of burnout.
    - Chips of all levels can vary in quality.
